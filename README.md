python basic
1. Write a program that takes three numbers and prints their sum. Every number is given on a separate line.
2. Write a program that reads the length of the base and the height of a right-angled triangle and prints the area. Every number is given on a separate line.
3. N students take K apples and distribute them among each other evenly. The remaining 
(the undivisible) part remains in the basket. How many apples will each single student get? How many apples will remain in the basket? The program reads the numbers N and K. It should print the two answers for the questions above.
4. Given the integer N - the number of minutes that is passed since midnight - how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock?The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59).For example, if N = 150, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight - i.e. now is 2:30 am. So, the program should print 2 30.
5. A school decided to replace the desks in three classrooms. Each desk sits two students. 
Given the number of students in each class, print the smallest possible number of desks 
that can be purchased.
The program should read three integers: the number of students in each of the three 
classes, a, b and c respectively.
In the first test there are three groups. The first group has 20 students and thus needs 10 
desks. The second group has 21 students, so they can get by with no fewer than 11 desks. 
11 desks are also enough for the third group of 22 students. So, we need 32 desks in total. 
6. Solve each of the following problems using Python Scripts. Make sure you use appropriate 
variable names and comments. When there is a final answer have Python print it to the 
screen.
A person’s body mass index (BMI) is defined as:
BMI=mass in kg / (height in m)2
.
7. You live 4 miles from university. The bus drives at 25mph but spends 2 minutes at each 
of the 10 stops on the way. How long will the bus journey take? Alternatively, you could 
run to university. You jog the first mile at 7mph; then run the next two at15mph; before 
jogging the last at 7mph again. Will this be quicker or slower than the bus?
8. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute 
the area. (area of circle = PI * r2
)
9. Write a python program to find sum of the first n positive integers. 
sum = (n*(n+1))/2
10. Write a Python program to convert seconds to day, hour, minutes and seconds

1. Check whether 5 is in list of first 5 natural numbers or not. Hint: List => [1,2,3,4,5]
2. WAP which accepts marks of four subjects and display total marks, percentage and 
grade.
Hint: more than 70% –> distinction, more than 60% –> first, more than 40% –> pass, 
less than 40% –> fail
3. Check whether the user input number is even or odd and display it to user.
4. Given three integers, print the smallest one. (Three integers should be user input)
5. For given integer x, print ‘True’ if it is positive, print ‘False’ if it is negative and print ‘zero’ 
if it is 0.
6. Given an integer number, print its last digit.
7. Given a positive real number, print its fractional part. 
8. Given a three-digit number. Find the sum of its digits. 
9. Check whether the given year is leap year or not. If year is leap print ‘LEAP YEAR’ else 
print ‘COMMON YEAR’.
Hint: • a year is a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 4 and is not 
exactly divisible by 100
• a year is always a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 400
10. Write a Python program to sum of three given integers. However, if two values are 
equal sum will be zero.
11. What is the result of 10**3?
12. Given x = 5, what will be the value of x after we run x+=3?
13. What is the output of ‘APPLE’ > ‘apple’?
14. What is the result of float (1)?
15. What will be the output of the following if a =2, b=3, c =4, d = 3?
a) a == b
b) a != d
c) b == d
d) a != c
e) a += c
f) b /= d
g) b > a
h) a < d
i) b-a == c-b
j) b >=d
